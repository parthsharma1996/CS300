Causes
____________________________________________________________________________
Although exact causes of Depression aren’t currently known . Plausible explanation based on current research can be divided into three major classes:-


1. Psychological:- Various theories have been put forward to explain the psychological causes of depression , the common thread between them is attributing a pessimistic personality along harsh circumstances(especially in early life) a cause of depression. However, a lot of other claims of the many  theories are difficult to  put to an empirical test and hence there’s a slim possibility of reaching a consensus. One theory that  has been validated by success of psychotherapy based on it is Cognitive Behavioral Theory . It postulates that faulty(unrealistically negative) schemas(or patterns of thinking) are the root cause of depression.
2.  Biological :- There is evidence for heritability of  depression which implies that depression might have biological roots . Further, SSRIs(Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) have been shown to be effective antidepressants which suggests that disruption in brain's serotonin levels might be responsible for depression. However, whether this is caused by psychological factors or it causes psychological factors cannot be asserted with the present evidence .
3. Social:- Social factors such as poverty have been linked to depression. Child abuse(emotional or physical) has been linked to development of depression later on in life. Ostracization and bullying(e.g. Bullying of people from the LGBTQ community( are found to increase risk of depression.


Prevention and Management
_____________________________________________________________________________
Antidepressants and talk therapy are the most widely used treatments for depression today.


Typically, SSRIs( Selective Serotonin Reuptake inhibitors) are used as antidepressants They. work by preventing reuptake of serotonin by neurons and hence increasing brain serotonin levels , which lifts mood. Antidepressants have been shown to work well for people with severe depression .However, many studies showed little to none efficacy in cases of mild to low  depression . Moreover, the efficacy varies significantly from person to person. 


The most widely accepted and empirically validated therapy today is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy(CBT) . It proposes the thoughts , emotions and behavior are interconnected , i.e your thoughts affect your emotions and behavior and so on. Depressed individuals tend to have overly negative mental schemas(thought patterns) which cause them to evaluate themselves, the world and the future in an unrealistically negative way. These negative thoughts lead to negative emotions and hence a low mood, which in turn leads to inactivity, procrastination and sleep disorders. Using a variety of Cognitive(Thought) and behavioral techniques , the schemas of the patient are modified to help her/him  get more active, adopt a more realistic world view and pursue pleasurable activities  .
