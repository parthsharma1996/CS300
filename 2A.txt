Prevention and Management
_____________________________________________________________________________
Antidepressants and talk therapy are the most widely used treatments for depression today.


Antidepressants have been shown to work well for people with severe depression .However, many studies showed little to none efficacy in cases of mild to low  depression 
Moreover, the efficacy varies significantly from person to person. 

The most widely accepted and empirically validated therapy today is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy(CBT) . 
It proposes that  thoughts , emotions and behavior are interconnected , i.e your thoughts affect your emotions and behavior and so on. Depressed individuals tend to 
have overly negative mental schemas(thought patterns) which cause them to evaluate themselves, the world and the future in an unrealistically negative way. 
Using a variety of Cognitive(Thought) and behavioral techniques , the schemas of the patient are modified to help her/him  get more active, adopt a more 
realistic world view and pursue pleasurable activities  .
